## What is it?

Arena Desktop brings the full arena.ai experience into a native Windows app and adds a local workspace on top:

- **Every arena mode, in-app**: Battle, Side by Side, Direct and a genuine **Agent Mode** that runs
  through arena.ai's own agentic API inside the app — no browser tab, no typing into the website.
- **Every modality**: Text, Image, Web Search, Code, Video and Auto, with the same rules as the website
  (Video and Auto are Battle-only; manual model picking appears only where arena.ai allows it).
- **Models that can touch your files**: with **Workspace Sync** on, models in Direct / Side by Side /
  Battle — and the built-in Local Agent — can list, read, write and edit files and run commands in a
  folder you choose, under a permission mode you control. Results loop back to the model automatically.
- **MCP servers and official Arena connectors**: connect local MCP servers (presets, JSON or CLI command)
  for the local tool loop, and manage your account's Arena connectors (GitHub, Drive, Notion, …) with
  per-connector on/off switches for Arena Agent.
- **A proper desktop workflow**: multiple arena.ai accounts with one-click switching, several chats
  generating in parallel with live status marks, local + cloud history, attachments, resizable panels.

Arena Desktop is a **harness, not a model**: all generation happens on arena.ai with your account.
The app orchestrates chats, tools, files and permissions around it.

## Features

### Chat & modes
- Battle Mode with anonymous A/B answers and voting (**A is better / B is better / Tie / Both are bad**);
  models are revealed after your vote, and the vote is sent to arena.ai for real.
- Side by Side and Direct with arena.ai's live model catalog (400+ models, no hardcoded lists).
- Agent Mode with two backends (pick the default in **Settings → Permissions**):
  **Arena Agent** — arena.ai's own agentic mode, streamed natively in-app (research, code, web search,
  files, clarifying questions); **Local Agent** — an arena model driving tools on your computer.
- A chat's mode, modality and model lock after the first message, exactly like on the website.
- Answers stream token by token, end the moment the model finishes, and tool calls render as clean
  activity cards — never as raw markup in the text.

### Workspace Sync & permissions
- The **Workspace Sync** switch sits next to the permission selector in every mode.
  On: models get the automatic folder-tools loop (`ls`, `read_file`, `search`, `write_file`,
  `edit_file`, `mkdir`, `delete`, `run_cmd`) in the folder you selected, and files the native
  Arena Agent creates in its cloud workspace are downloaded into that folder automatically
  (hash-deduped across turns, one permission decision per chat).
  Off: models only chat, Code-mode files are not mirrored, and Arena Agent files stay in Arena's workspace.
- The loop keeps the model's context lean: long tool outputs are saved to `.arena-artifacts/` in the
  folder and only a preview travels back (the model reads the full file only if it needs to),
  repeated output lines collapse, `read_file` reads line ranges, and a model that keeps repeating
  the same tool call is stopped automatically.
- **Ask several models at once**: in Direct, fan one prompt out to 2–4 models you pick; every
  answer lands in its own sub-chat and the main chat gets all answers plus a short comparison.
- **Undo agent changes**: before the agent overwrites or deletes a file, a checkpoint snapshot is
  taken — every turn that changed files gets a one-click Undo that restores the originals.
- **Full-text chat search, Markdown export, fork-from-any-message**, and attaching whole
  workspace files/folders as prompt text for modes without tools.
- **Automations**: scheduled Local Agent runs (daily / hourly / every N minutes) with a
  per-automation permission mode; each run becomes its own chat.
- **Faster, harder to hang**: parallel read-only sub-agents, batched file reads with
  unchanged-file deduplication, a 90-second stream watchdog, an idle-timeout on shell
  commands (interactive programs are refused up front), and loop detection with a
  wrap-up warning before the round limit.
- **Model picker upgrades**: pin favorites, hide the rest, Vision/Docs capability badges and
  optional leaderboard Elo next to each model — sourced from daily public snapshots.
- **Plan approval & live checklist**: before substantial changes the agent can present its plan
  as a card — **Approve**, **Cancel**, or send revisions in your own words — then keep a visible
  `set_todos` checklist updated as it works, so you always see what's done and what's next.
  Project instructions from **AGENTS.md** in the workspace root are picked up automatically
  alongside MEMORY.md.
- **The model can ask you**: with the `ask_user` tool the Local Agent (and its sub-agents) can pause
  mid-task and ask a clarifying question with 2–4 answer options plus a free-text field — your
  answer returns to the model and the work continues, instead of it guessing on a fork that
  matters. The native Arena Agent's own structured questions work the same way: options and a
  free-text answer appear in the app, the answer returns to the same Arena session, and the
  question and answer stay in the transcript.
- **Arena Agent image and voice choices**: when Arena generates two image options, both open
  full-size in the app; picking one continues the same session. Both images—and, after the
  choice, both model names—stay visible in the saved chat. Voice auditions play in-app too;
  the selected voice, its returned voice ID and your play/listen statistics are sent back to
  the same Arena session and preserved in history.
- **v5.7 workflow pack**: a Ctrl+K command palette (chats, full-text hits, Compact, exports,
  models and panels), a Workspace Git tab (status, diff, stage/unstage and local commits),
  a heavy-send warning for large contexts on premium models, standalone styled HTML chat
  export beside Markdown, and safe `arenadesktop://` links that can open a chat or prefill
  a prompt without sending it. Saved cookie files and account sessions are now protected
  with Windows DPAPI for the current user (older plaintext files migrate on load).
- **Sub-agents**: the Local Agent (and Direct with Workspace Sync) can delegate a self-contained
  sub-task to a child chat with its own Arena session and tool loop — research (read-only) or work —
  and pick the sub-agent's model. Only the child's summary returns to the parent, so long projects
  stop drowning in exploration noise. Child chats nest under their parent and open like any chat.
- **Compact button** next to Workspace Sync: when a conversation nears Arena's context limit
  (~80k characters — the button lights up), one click continues the same chat in a fresh Arena
  session seeded with a summary, instead of the chat dying with empty replies. The full
  transcript stays in the app; only the server-side context restarts.
- **Memory across chats**, in the style of Claude Code: a general memory plus a per-project
  `MEMORY.md` in the selected folder travel with the first message of each new conversation.
  Models can update `MEMORY.md` while they work ("remember this"), Compact appends its session
  summary there, and both files are editable in Settings → Memory.
- Desktop comforts: update checks against GitHub Releases (Settings → About), an optional system
  tray with a global Ctrl+Alt+A show/hide hotkey, settings export/import (never account cookies),
  a copyable diagnostics report, portable mode (`portable.txt` beside the EXE keeps data in `./data`),
  and launch flags (`--profile <id|email>`, `--background`, `--mode <id>`).
- Permission modes modelled on Claude Code (Plan / Ask / Accept edits / Bypass) gate every local action;
  requests are tied to the chat that asked, so a waiting permission never blocks your other chats.
- Code (webdev) answers have their created/edited files mirrored into your folder
  (Battle writes lanes into `option-a` / `option-b`).

### Connectors & MCP
- **Official Arena connectors** from your account load automatically; authorize new ones from the app
  and toggle each on/off (an off connector is really excluded from new Arena Agent sessions).
- **Local MCP servers**: add via ready-made presets, a JSON config, or a CLI command (`Add` button in
  the right panel). Their tools join the same loop and permission system as the built-in file tools.

### Accounts & history
- Sign in in a separate arena.ai window (it closes itself once verified) or by pasting cookies.
- **Multiple accounts**: add accounts, see which is current, switch in one click; sessions are kept
  per account and chat lists are separated. Switching is blocked while a chat is generating.
- Chats appear in the sidebar **the moment you send**, can be reopened while still generating, and
  continue in the same arena.ai session. Cloud-only chats from arena.ai show under “Only on arena.ai”
  and can be opened and continued. Linked chats also check arena.ai when opened, and
  **Refresh from Arena** in the chat header pulls in turns added in a browser without duplicates.
- The sidebar marks running chats with a spinner and finished-but-unread chats with a green check.
- Deleting a chat in the app also archives it on arena.ai.
- Several chats can generate **in parallel**, each with its own Stop button.

### Attachments & polish
- `+` button, drag-and-drop and paste-from-clipboard uploads with arena.ai's real per-mode limits
  (files upload to Arena storage first; oversize/wrong-type files are rejected with a clear reason).
- Arena-matching interface: dark theme, unified composer chips, centered home composer,
  resizable sidebar/workspace panels (sizes are remembered), English-only UI.
- Friendly errors: rate limits explain which limit hit and when it resets (daily spend, per-modality,
  per-model, new-account video gate) instead of a bare “429”. Built-in request pacing spaces out
  bursts and queues a resend until Arena's reset, so short throttles stop killing tasks (it does
  not raise Arena's daily usage limit; strength is adjustable in Settings).
- **Rich workspace previews** (v5.5.1): clicking a file renders HTML/SVG in a sandboxed frame
  (relative CSS/images from the same folder load too), Markdown as a document, images,
  audio, video and PDF inline; text/code keeps the classic read-only view with Copy and
  Download; anything else offers Download. Agent-produced audio plays in chat as well.
- **Agent Gateway** (v5.5, off by default): the genuine Arena Agent can use selected local MCP
  servers on your PC (Blender, Roblox Studio, files…) — and, since v5.6.1, your picked
  Workspace folder itself as a built-in `workspace` server (list/read/search/write/edit files
  and shell commands, confined to that folder; its own toggle in Settings → Gateway). With
  both opt-ins on, a temporary pairing-protected Cloudflare tunnel session starts automatically
  with Workspace Sync; Agent chats receive the address invisibly, and a continued chat is
  re-handed a fresh address whenever its tunnel was stopped or expired. Every call follows
  your permission mode, sessions expire and are revocable with one click. Settings →
  Components installs the one external helper (cloudflared, official build, checksum-verified)
  only when you ask.
- Everyday polish (v5.1.6): human-check windows come to the front instead of hiding behind the
  app; messages can be queued while a chat is generating; composer drafts are kept per chat;
  the Compact chip doubles as a live context-size meter; the model picker shows Recent models;
  Ctrl+F searches inside the open chat; workspace files drag straight into the composer; and a
  soft sound plays when a chat finishes while the window is in the background.
- Daily-limit survival (v5.1.5): Settings → Usage logs the app's own sends per account/day with a
  rate-limit history; agent turns go on a context diet (repeated listings/searches answered from
  cache until files change, Compact offered earlier); research subagents default to light
  (Mini/Flash/Lite-class) models and light models are badged in the picker. An explicitly opt-in
  account failover can continue a task on another saved account when the daily cap hits — off by
  default, because rotating accounts around Arena's daily limit is a fair-use grey zone.

## Quick start

### Run the EXE (easiest)

1. Download `Arena-Desktop.exe`, save it in a normal folder and double-click. No Python needed.
2. Requires 64-bit Windows 10/11 with the Microsoft Edge **WebView2 Runtime** and .NET Framework 4.8
   (Windows 11 includes both). The one-file EXE starts slowly the first time while it unpacks, and —
   being unsigned — may trigger a SmartScreen warning.
3. Click the profile area → **Sign in**, finish sign-in in the Arena window, and you're ready.

### Run from source

1. Extract the source tree to a normal folder (don't run it inside a ZIP).
2. Install **Python 3.11+** and the Edge WebView2 Runtime.
3. Double-click **`START_ARENA_DESKTOP.bat`** — first launch creates `.venv` and installs
   `requirements.txt` (internet required), then opens the app.

Manual launch:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m arena.desktop
```

There is also a terminal CLI (`python arena-cli.py`, or `start.bat`) kept from the project's origins.

App data (config, chats, accounts, logs) lives in `%USERPROFILE%\.arena-personal\`.

## Using the app

- **Pick a folder** with the workspace chip on the left of the composer, choose a permission mode,
  and turn **Workspace Sync** on if models may work in that folder.
- **Mode menu**: Battle Mode / Agent Mode / Side by Side / Direct. **Work type** menu:
  Video / Image / Web Search / Code / Text / Auto (hidden in Agent Mode).
- **Agent Mode** never asks you to pick a model — Arena routes automatically, like on the website.
- **Accounts menu** (profile, bottom-left): switch accounts, **+ Add account**, Settings, Sign out.
- **Right panel**: workspace file tree on top, **Connectors** below (official Arena connectors plus
  your local MCP servers).
- **Settings**: account/session, permissions (incl. the default Agent backend for new chats),
  workspace folder, and About.

## Build the EXE yourself

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller arena-cli.spec --noconfirm
# → dist\Arena-Desktop.exe  (single file, windowed)
```

`scripts/check_exe.py <path-to-exe>` sanity-checks a built binary (bundled modules, assets, version).

## Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pytest playwright
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests --ignore=tests/test_ui_browser.py   # unit/API suite
$env:RUN_BROWSER_TESTS=1; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_ui_browser.py  # UI suite (demo mode)
```

The UI has a built-in demo mode (`?demo=1`) with simulated data — handy for development without an account.

## Honest limitations

- **Windows only** (WebView2). macOS/Linux would need a different shell.
- **Arena's own limits apply** and cannot be bypassed from any client: daily spend caps, per-modality
  and per-model rate limits, and the new-account gate for Video. The app explains them; it can't lift them.
- **Human checks stay manual** by design: the app opens the check, you tick it.
- **Code mode is arena's sandbox**, not your PC: the app mirrors files the model created/edited, but
  the sandbox can't see arbitrary local files, and its `bash`/media steps stay in the sandbox.
  See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the current list.
- The EXE is **not code-signed**, so SmartScreen may warn on first run.
- arena.ai changes its frontend regularly; server-action IDs (voting, archiving) are rediscovered by
  name at runtime, but a bigger arena.ai overhaul could still require an app update.
